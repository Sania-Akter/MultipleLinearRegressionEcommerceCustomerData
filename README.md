🛍️ E-Commerce Customer Spending Prediction using Multiple Linear RegressionThis project applies Multiple Linear Regression to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers of an E-commerce company. The model uses customer interaction metrics as independent variables to determine which factors contribute most significantly to a customer's annual spending.🎯 Project GoalThe primary goal is to build a linear regression model that accurately predicts a customer's "Yearly Amount Spent" based on four key features:Avg. Session Length: Average session length of in-store style advice sessions.Time on App: Average time (in minutes) spent on the mobile app.Time on Website: Average time (in minutes) spent on the website.Length of Membership: How long the customer has been a member (in years).💾 DataThe project uses the Ecommerce Customers.csv dataset, which contains 500 rows of customer data with 8 columns.Data PreviewEmailAddressAvatarAvg.

Session Length (Column 3)Time on App (Column 4)Time on Website (Column 5)Length of Membership (Column 6)Dependent Variable (Y):Yearly Amount Spent (Column 7)📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Before building the model, the relationships between the features and the target variable were inspected using scatter plots.Observations from the plots:Length of Membership shows the strongest positive linear correlation with Yearly Amount Spent.Time on App also shows a positive correlation.Avg. Session Length shows a weak, slightly positive correlation.Time on Website shows no clear linear correlation.⚙️ Methodology and ImplementationThe project follows a standard machine learning workflow for regression:Data Preprocessing: The independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (Y) were extracted.Train-Test Split: The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using random_state=42 for reproducibility.Feature Scaling: The features were scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data, ensuring all independent variables contribute equally to the model fitting process.Model Training: A LinearRegression model from sklearn.linear_model was trained on the scaled training data.🔬 Model ResultsLinear Regression EquationAfter training, the model's intercept and coefficients were calculated:Intercept: 501.99Coefficients: [25.25, 38.70, 0.32, 63.54]The multiple linear regression equation, when using the scaled features, is:$$\hat{Y} = 501.99 + 25.25(X_{\text{Session}}) + 38.70(X_{\text{App}}) + 0.32(X_{\text{Website}}) + 63.54(X_{\text{Membership}})$$Interpretation of CoefficientsSince the features were scaled, the coefficients directly indicate the importance of each feature in predicting the yearly spend:FeatureCoefficientInterpretationLength of Membership63.54The most influential factor. A one-unit increase in membership length (scaled) results in the largest increase in predicted yearly spending.Time on App38.70The second most influential factor.Avg. Session Length25.25The third most influential factor.Time on Website0.32The least influential factor, suggesting time spent on the website has a negligible impact on overall spending compared to the other variables.Evaluation MetricsThe model was evaluated using the test set (x_test):RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 10.48MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 8.56R² Score: 0.9778The $\text{R}^2$ value of $\mathbf{0.9778}$ is very high (close to 1), indicating that approximately 97.78% of the variance in the Yearly Amount Spent can be explained by the independent variables in the model. The low MAE and RMSE suggest that the model's predictions are close to the actual values.
